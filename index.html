      <h2 id="abt">About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Danielle and I am a High School Student from Illinois. I love taking APCS classes and have been since my Sophomore year. Similarly I enjoy taking a lot of different math classes. Since freshman year, I have been a member of my school's state qualifying Math Team. Also, I love playing tennis and I am on my school's varsity tennis team.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
    <div class="circle"></div>
      <p class="expp" >My first exposure to coding was in Middle School when I wrote C++ to code a stoplight. My passion continued into High School when I joined the Girls Who Code club during my freshman year. From this I have had experience with web development, app development, and worked with Microbits. During my Sophomore year I took AP Computer Science A and learned Java. I have participated in two Kode With Klossy camps. In 2021, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In 2022, I did the Data Science camp where we coded in SQL and Python. Another program I have completed is the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program where I received more exposure to Web development.</p>

      <h2>My Future Plans</h2>
      <p>In my future, I hope to continue learning more programming languages and gain further experience in this field. When I’m in college I hope to study either Computer Science or Software Engineering. I plan to consider adding a minor or second major with something that can complement a CS major.</p>
